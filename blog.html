 <h2>JUDGEMENT :)</h2>
 
<h4>Hi!</h4>
 <p class="quote">
   Judgement !  When I say this you might be thinking I'm gonna give lecture about people judging around, how negative environment they unknowingly create by passing their useless judgements and what not. 
 Well , There's a lot to say on it ,So let me begin with it...
</p>
<img class="maz" src="smile.jpg">
<div class="beauty">Beauty is bought by the judgement...WHat? </div>
  <div>I mean yes ,If our eyes wouldn't have judged it how was it even possible .Do not get confused with Beautiful and beauty, beautiful is human judgement .Beauty is all.The difference is everything.
  it's very well-known that there's both positive and negative aspects of everything(exceptions might be there).In case of judgement, the positive case can arise when you are judged very correctly and there's no denial from your side in his/her opinion about you, but it rarely happens. 
  There's no denial atleast  from my side in saying that judgement is a bad frequency. Nobody likes being judged but it's happening everywhere, like somebody might be  reading this blog and will be passing his\her own judgements in their own mind and who cares? because I believe :to be unafraid of the judgements of the others is the greatest freedom anyone can have ,and I urge you to think  similar about it:)
  There are MILLIONS OF PEOPLE who are depressed , suppressed and they think the worst about themselves due to this judgment. Not everyone of us have that emotional and mental balance to tackle or to ignore judgements and continue living normally. And in those MILLIONS OF PEOPLE there might me one of your friend whom you might have  judged being so biased and have felt so good after passing your useless judgement or you might havn't  felt anything but think about that person whom you judged:) You will never get to know about the harms and bad impacts of your judgement caused for him\her.</div>

 <p>Lets not judge ,Lets admire ,Lets be positive think positive and lets spread the positivity as much as we can and lets kill that cancerous disease of judging others and making them feel uncomfortable, unwanted, not be  worthy of something etc.</p>
